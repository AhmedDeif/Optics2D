    <string name="guide_text"> The refractive index (n) of a transparent material can be determined by measuring the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction as a ray of light enters, or leaves the material. Refractive index is a number that indicates how fast light travels in a transparent medium. The higher the refractive index the slower the speed of light in that medium.Snell\'s Law will be used to determine the index of refraction. Snell\'s Law gives a relationship between the angle of incidence ﾎ論1 and its medium\'s refractive index n_1 and the angle of refraction ﾎ論2 and its medium\'s refractive index n_2 using the equation n_1*sin(ﾎ論1) = n_2 * sin(ﾎ論2).</string>
